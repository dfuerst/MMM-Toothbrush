# MMM-NetworkScanner
A module for MagicMirror which determines the status of devices on the network based on their MAC address.

## Installation

In your terminal, install `arp-scan`:
````
cd ~/
sudo apt-get install arp-scan   
````

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:
````
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
````

Clone this repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/ianperrin/MMM-NetworkScanner.git
````

Go to the modules folder:
````
cd MMM-NetworkScanner
````

Install the dependencies (`sudo`):
````
npm install
````

Add the module to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
    {
        module: 'MMM-NetworkScanner',
        position: 'top_left', 
        config: {
            // Optional config options
        }        
    },
````

## Config Options
| **Option** | **Default** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `devices` | [] | an array of device objects e.g. { macAddress: "aa:bb:cc:11:22:33", name: "DEVICE-NAME", icon: "FONT-AWESOME-ICON"} |
| `showUnknown` | true | shows devices found on the network even if not specified in the `devices` option |
| `showOffline` | true | shows devices specified in the `devices` option even when offline |
| `keepAlive` | 180 | how long (in seconds) a device should be considered 'alive' since it was last found on the network |
| `updateInterval` | 10 | how often (in seconds) the module should scan the network  |

### Example Config
Scan every 5 seconds and only display the specified devices whether they are online or offline. Devices will be considered online for 5 mins after they are last seen:
````javascript
    {
        module: 'MMM-NetworkScanner',
        position: 'top_left', 
        config: {
            devices: [
                    { macAddress: "1a:1b:1c:1a:1b:1c", name: "Server", icon: "server"},
                    { macAddress: "2a:2b:2c:2a:2b:2c", name: "Desktop", icon: "desktop"},
                    { macAddress: "3a:3b:3c:3a:3b:3c", name: "Laptop", icon: "laptop"},
                    { macAddress: "4a:4b:4c:4a:4b:4c", name: "Mobile", icon: "mobile"},
                ],
            showUnknown: false,
            showOffline: true,
            keepAlive: 300,
            updateInterval: 5
        }        
    },
````

## Updating

To update the module to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your MMM-NetworkScanner module folder and type the following command:

````
git pull

If you haven't changed the modules, this should work without any problems. 
Type `git status` to see your changes, if there are any, you can reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, git pull should be possible.
